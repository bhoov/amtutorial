# Tutorial on Modern Methods in Associative Memory

> A complete introduction to Associative Memories and Hopfield Networks
> for the Modern AI Era

## Getting started

*Commits to the main branch will automatically build the docs website*.
Develop in feature branches, merge to main for deployment.

We have tried to streamline the installation of the repo as much as
possible.

### Pre-requisites

Install `quarto` (multi-step instructions
[here](https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-quarto.html)) and `uv`
(`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`). We also use `conda`
for managing the `ffmpeg` dependency, which only matters if `ffmpeg` is
not already installed on your system.

### Running example notebooks in `nbs/tutorial`

``` sh
conda install conda-forge::ffmpeg conda-forge::openh264 
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

With this env active, you can run the desired notebooks. The first time
you run the notebooks will be slow â€“ we do some initial preprocessing
for caching long-running code.

You can view a local version of the website with `nbdev_preview`.

**Optional** If you want to develop the interactive frontend in
`javascript/`, you can install `nodejs` and `npm` and run:

``` sh
# OPTIONAL: install interactive frontend tooling
conda install conda-forge::nodejs
npm install --prefix javascript && npm run build --prefix javascript 
```

## Deploying

Deploy to `tutorial.amemory.net` by pushing commits to the `main` branch
after building the site locally.

``` sh
uv run nbdev_export && uv run nbdev_docs && git add . && git commit -m "Update site" && git push
```
