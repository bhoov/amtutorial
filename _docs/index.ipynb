    "### Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Install `quarto` (multi-step instructions [here](https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-quarto.html)) and `uv` (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`). We also use `conda` for managing the `ffmpeg` dependency, which only matters if `ffmpeg` is not already installed on your system.\n",

    "### Running example notebooks in `nbs/tutorial`\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda install conda-forge::ffmpeg conda-forge::openh264 \n",
    "uv sync\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this env active, you can run the desired notebooks. The first time you run the notebooks will be slow -- we do some initial preprocessing for caching long-running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view a local version of the website with `nbdev_preview`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional** If you want to develop the interactive frontend in `javascript/`, you can install `nodejs` and `npm` and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# OPTIONAL: install interactive frontend tooling\n",
    "conda install conda-forge::nodejs\n",
    "npm install --prefix javascript && npm run build --prefix javascript \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deploying\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploy to `tutorial.amemory.net` by pushing commits to the `main` branch after building the site locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "uv run nbdev_export && uv run nbdev_docs && git add . && git commit -m \"Update site\" && git push\n",
